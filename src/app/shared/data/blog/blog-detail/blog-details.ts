            detail1:'Software Quality Assurance (SQA) refers to the process of ensuring that software product\'s and systems meet specified quality standards and fulfill customer requirements.',
            detail2:' It involves a systematic and planned set of activities that focus on assessing and improving the quality of software throughout its development lifecycle.<br /><h6>The main goals of Software Quality Assurance include:<br /><h6>1.-Defect Prevention:</h6> Identifying and preventing defects or errors in software early in the development process. This involves establishing quality standards, implementing best practices, and employing various techniques to minimize the occurrence of defects.<br /><h6>2.-Quality Planning:</h6> Developing a comprehensive quality management plan that outlines the specific quality objectives, criteria, and processes to be followed throughout the software development cycle. This plan serves as a roadmap for the SQA activities.<br /><h6>3.-Requirement Analysis:</h6> Thoroughly analyzing customer requirements and ensuring that they are clear, complete, and feasible. This helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ambiguities that can lead to software defects.<br /><h6>4.-Test Planning and Execution:</h6> Planning and executing test activities to verify and validate the software against the defined requirements. This includes designing test cases, conducting various testing techniques (such as functional testing, performance testing, security testing, etc.), and reporting defects for resolution.<br /><h6>5.-Process Monitoring and Improvement:</h6> Continuously monitoring and evaluating the software development processes to identify areas of improvement. This involves analyzing metrics, feedback, and performance data to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability.<br /><h6>6.-Standards and Compliance:</h6> Ensuring that the software development process follows established industry standards, regulations, and compliance requirements. This includes adhering to coding standards, security guidelines, accessibility standards, and any applicable legal or industry-specific requirements.<br /><h6>7.-Documentation and Reporting:</h6> Maintaining accurate and comprehensive documentation of the software quality assurance activities, test results, and any issues or defects encountered. Proper reporting enables effective communication among stakeholders and aids in decision-making.<br /><br />Software Quality Assurance is a proactive approach that aims to prevent quality issues rather than just detecting and fixing them after development. By implementing SQA practices, organizations can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce costs related to rework or customer support, and improve the overall quality and reliability of software products.',
